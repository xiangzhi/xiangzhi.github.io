I am a Computer Science Assistant Professor at Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University working on Human-Robot Interaction. 

<div style="border:1px solid #ccc;padding:1%;font-weight:bold">
I am recruiting multiple PhD student for Fall 2025. If you are interested in pursuing a PhD exploring human-robot interaction related questions and want to live in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9EgbCaeyDs">Boston</a>, please apply to <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/computer-science-phd/">Northeastern's CS PhD program</a> and mention my name in your application.

My research explores how autonomous robotic systems can collaborate with multiple robots and other embodied systems to provide assistance to diverse users. We use an interdisciplinary and iterative approach where we develop heterogeneous robotic systems that work together to complete tasks that neither robot could complete by itself. Through our explorations, we gain insights into human behavior in response to robots, generate new interaction paradigms and design guidelines, and make advancement in robotic systems and algorithms.

I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow as part of [NSF AI Institute for Collaborative Assistance and Responsive Interaction for Networked Groups (AI-CARING)](https://www.ai-caring.org/) at Georgia Institute of Technology. I received my Ph.D. in Robotics in Dec 2021 from Carnegie Mellon University and my B.S. in Computer Sciences from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015.
