I am a Human-Robot Interaction Researcher. My research explores how autonomous robotic systems can collaborate with multiple robots and other embodied systems to provide assistance to diverse users. I use an interdisciplinary and iterative approach where I develop heterogeneous robotic systems that work together to complete tasks that neither robot could complete by itself. Through our explorations, we gain insights into human behavior in response to robots, generate new interaction paradigms and design guidelines, and make advancement in robotic systems and algorithms.

I received my Ph.D. in Robotics in Dec 2021 from Carnegie Mellon University and my B.S. in Computer Sciences from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015.
